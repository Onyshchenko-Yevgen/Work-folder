      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
         
    <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language <span class="two">(HTML)</span></strong> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
</p>
<p>Web browsers receive <span class="two">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="two">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<p><span class="two">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With <span class="two">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="two">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <span class="two">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="one"><span class="three">&lt img /&gt</span></span> and<span class="one"><span class="three">&lt input /&gt</span></span> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="one"><span class="three">&lt p &gt</span></span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

 <h2>Markup</h2>
 
 <p><span class="two">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called <i>tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references.</i> <span class="two">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span class="one"><span class="three">&lt h1 &gt</span></span> and <span class="one"><span class="three">&lt/h1&gt</span></span>, although some represent <i>empty elements</i> and so are unpaired, for example <span class="one"><span class="three">&lt img &gt</span></span> . The first tag in such a pair is the <i>start tag</i>, and the second is the <i>end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</i>
</p>
    
<p>Another important component is the HTML <i>document type declaration</i>, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
  
  <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
  
  <div><code><span class="one">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
    &lthtml&gt
        &lthead&gt
            &lttitle&gt</span>This is a title<span class="one"> &lt/title&gt
        &lt/head&gt
        &ltbody&gt
            &ltp&gt</span>Hello world!<span class="one"> &lt/p&gt
        &lt/body&gt
    &lt/html&gt</span></code></div>
   
        
</body>
